# OSPO Glossary

Welcome to the glossary for the Open Source Program Offices (OSPOs) Book. As you may know, the world of open source is vast and complex, with many different terms and concepts that can be difficult to navigate. Our aim with this glossary is not to provide a definitive or general definition of these terms, but to clarify what we mean specifically under the context of this book.

We believe that it is important to be concise and clear in our definitions, and to reference existing descriptions and resources whenever possible. This will help us avoid creating a glossary that is overly complex or difficult to understand, and will ensure that our readers have access to the best information and resources available.

As you explore the terms and concepts in this glossary, we encourage you to use the descriptions and links provided. And if you have any suggestions for additional terms or resources that we should include, please don't hesitate to open an Issue or include new terms by opening a PR!
