Open source culture refers to a set of values and practices that promote collaboration, transparency, and community-driven development. It is often associated with the open source software movement, but can be applied to other areas as well, such as open science, open hardware, and open education. This Glossary references the four opens philosophy, created by the Open Infra (former OpenStack) community. [Learn more](https://openinfra.dev/four-opens/).
